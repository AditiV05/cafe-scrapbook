## 🎯 Problem Statement

Finding a café that actually fits your mood (work-friendly, calm, aesthetic, budget, etc.) is harder than it should be.

Most platforms:
- Overwhelm users with irrelevant data  
- Don’t allow intuitive filtering  
- Focus more on visuals than decision-making  

**Cafe Finder** is built to solve that gap by offering:
- Fast discovery
- Meaningful filters
- A calm, focused browsing experience
